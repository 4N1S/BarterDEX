# Official BarterDEX README

The BarterDEX application created by Komodo Platform allows trading cryptocurrency coins without a counterparty risk.
 The protocol is open-source and trading is available for any coin that any developers choose to connect to The BarterDEX.
 The parent project, Komodo Platform, freely provides BarterDEX technology through open-source philosophy. BarterDEX fully realizes decentralized order matching, trade clearing, and settlement. The order
-matching aspect uses a low-level pubkey-to-pubkey messaging protocol, and the final settlement is executed through an atomic cross-chain swap.
